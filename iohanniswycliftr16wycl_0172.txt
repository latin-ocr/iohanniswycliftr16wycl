Miscellaneous Traeis, Nos. 54-61 in Shirley's Catalogoe,
which were copied by Dr. Buddensieg, and were in the
hands of Dr. Schnabel of Dresden‚ as editor, till his death
three years ago. Also, for 1902 or 1903, the De Paestum,
which has for many years been in the hands of M. Patera
of Prag, has just been sent to Professor J. Loserth, so
that it will probably go to press next year. For 1904,
the Rev. Dr. Buddensieg hopes to produce his edition of
De Verifafffi and then all Wyclif's great Summa leeoloqz‘ae
will be in type, except the De Mandata· Dee? and De Statu
Innocentiae, which Mr. F. D. Matthew will take up as soon
as his help to other editors leaves him time for his own texts.

The other works of Wyelif remaining unprinted and not
likely to be included in the sec-ond volume of Illisvellam‘esg
now in charge of the Rev. J. P.Whitney‚ are, byShirley's Nos:

6, De Materia et Forma* ξ 26. De Imaginibus.†
7. De Materia (?).† 25. Peccatum Mortale et veniale-r
S. De Ente, Bk. 1³³4, Bk. IL* 32. Errare in Materia Fidei, &onL
9. Replicatio (10 Univei·salibiis.* (45. Coninientary 011 N. Test. ?n0t
10. De [711110183111108,””’ἐ ’ Wyelif’s.†)
11. Ι)0 Animas* 64. De Paupertate 01111811κί-
13. De Fide Catholica* (69. ,9 part ot' De Potestate Papae.)
24 De Γ1-οΡῙ10110..ἦε 70. De Clavibus Ecclesiae*

Members have, then, to keep “pegging away '' till the
work they have set themselves is done, and England's long-
due debt to Wyclif's memory paid. For that, money is
wanted. Who will give it?

In order to increase the Society's funds, the Executive
Committee have resolved that any Member may give the
right to any Library or person to buy the first fourteen
years of the Society's publications, 1882-95, at half-price
—19 volumes at 8 guineas and a half—provided that
with this sum are paid the full Subscriptions for 1896,
1897, and 1898.

 

 

England, Europe, and the rest of the Christian world owe
so much to the memory of Wyclif‚ that support ought to be
forthcoming for the printing of his Works, the records of
his thoughts and life. Two-thirds of the Society's task will
be done by 1900. It is for our Members to see that the
other third is finished speedily. Editors are ready and
willing. Money alone is wanting.
