INTRODUCTION. IX

respectively.' Two hands have worked at this as on the soregoing trac-
tate; no doubt the same ones, The first is from f. 53 to f. 60‘; the
second, from 61 to 75¹: both belong to the first decades of the XW¹¹
century. With the exception of the first letter in the tractate, no initials
are filled up. There are many marginal corrections, also catchwords;
some of the gaps are not filled in, others have been filled in at a later
date with a different ink. A note, “Gertrudis virginis’³‚ at the end of
Ch. ΙΙΙ, shows probably that the copyist had reached this point of his work
on the 17⁸ll March, St. Gertrude's day. The Argumeazlmn is at the beginn-
ing of the book3 the final verse, “Explicit‚³³ &o is wanting. After
“semper regnat’³‚ come the words ²³13. de Sy1nonia”, and an index of
catchwords which differs from that in a and g. Α few specimens will
suffice.

Utrum liceat curiam Romanam adire pro beneficiis, c. 5. C.

Quare clericis legis civiles et phisice sunt prohibite, d. 9.

And so on. The numbers refer to the separate paginatiom the

letters, to the columns,

ὁ. Cod. Vindob. 3937 (f). Size, 29 cm by 21. Paper. 186 leaves,
many of them blank, but numbered from first to last by a modern hand,
On the cover and fly-leaf the words “Dono habui” are written in a
hand of the XV1¹¹¹ century. Inside the cover is an index of contents‚ in
XV1¹¹ century handwriting. The MS. is a-collection of tracts by Hus,
Richard Fitzralph and others, noticed at some length in the Tabulae
Manuscriptorum: nothing of Wyclif is here, except De Simonia, from
f. 115 to f. 137‘. The writing belongs to the first years of the XV¹¹¹ cen-
tury; each page is in two columns, with here and there a catchword and
explanatory notes on the margim the word Nola occurs frequently. There is
no lettered subdivision of the chapter-S, but the paragraphs are denoted by
the sign q in red ink. The copy is very incorrect‚ and full of mistake8‚
which quite destroy the sense, and show that the scribe did not under-
stand what he was writing. After the final verses “Explicit” &o there
follows: “Amen dicant”; and then, in a different ink: “Finitus est iste

tractatus anno 1401.‘'

1 This confirms what is known from other MSS. that the original ‘folio' was
the open double page folded in the middle. The word was afterwards used sor

a leaf. (Note lry Dr. F. J. Furnivall.)
