X INTRODUCTION.

7. cod, Prag. X. Eo (g). Fully described by Dr. Buddensieg‚ Pol,
VVorks of W.‚ Introduction, pp. L, LII.

De Simonicz (ff. 69—131‘) is written in a slovenly hand, belonging
to the first decade of the XV¹¹¹ century, and the same as in the tractate
immediately before it, “De Officio Pastoralz·³>, as far as f. 121, where
the writing abruptly becomes smaller and much more cramped until the
end, and is apparently the work of another hand. The few corrections
to be found in the text are for the most part in two hands; one large
and bold, the other smaller and more delicate. Red catchwords on the
margin are numerous at first, but are afterwards to be met with only
on separate pages, The Argmnentnm, placed at the beginning of the
treatise, and also the text of the work itself‚ are adorned with tasteless
initials; but those which begin the chapters, in red and blue ink, are
in somewhat less bad taste. The subdivisions of the chapters are indi-
cated by marginal letters. At the end (ff. 126—-131¹) there is an alpha-
betical index of catchwords, with the title e'Registrum super De
Symonia³'.

8. Cod. Dubl. (Trinity College) C. Ι, 24 (h). Described in De
Aposlczsia by Mr. Dziewicki.¹ The Argumentum to De simonia is wanting.

9. Cod. Vindob. 1343 (i). Described in De Apostasia, p. IV.

De simonia (ff. 1—-36¹). Over the beginning of the text, there are
the following words in red ink: “Incipit de Symonia et est liber X in
ordine summe sue.³' The MS. of the flrst decade of the XV¹¹¹ century,
though not quite so elegantly adorned as b, is evidently the work of a
careful penman. The subdivisions of the chapters are indicated by
letters of the alphabet. Many corrections in the margin; also at the top
and bottom of the pages, which have each two columns. There are also
catchwords, which fully indicate the contentS. Instead of preceding the

text, the Argumentum comes after the closing lines, ⁶‘Explicit,³’ &c.

¹ l wished to have a copy of the first two pageS, on account of the spelling
of which l make mention further: but as that could not be procured, the first page

was photographed instead.
