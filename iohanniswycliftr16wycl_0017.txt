Subsequently, however, the value of cl was modified by a thorough
correction with a manuscript closely related to lz, so that the text be-
comes almost identieal with that of the latter MS. The corrections of a,
which are perhaps based on an i text, are much less important, and

sequent modifications do not change the original relations of the MSS.
to each other.

The best text is supplied by Ιι. This is seen, not indeed at first sight,
but after attentixely comparing it with the others; both its pedigree and
the similarity of the corrections in cl tend to confirm this decision. It
generally gives the best sense of all of them: in most of the places where it
seriously differs from the others, its readings are usually found preferable.
However, to construet a text, we are obliged to avail ourselves both ofz'
and of the Z group. In doubtful cases and in the case ofindifferent variations‚
so far asI have noted them,I have kept to the readings of lt. It
may often be wrong, Ι admit; but the principle of following in such
cases the MS. which is the best in the main, is the only means we have
of preserving the text from being formed by the editor's own arbitrary
choice. I ought even to have followed the spelling of l1; but circums-
stances rendered that impossible. When in Vienna, Ι was indeed able
(by Prof. Ingram’s courtesy) to collate the Dublin MS. with my copy;
but I was not certain that it was the best until long after Ι had returned

it. Ιη my collation, I had overlooked the spelling, and should have
