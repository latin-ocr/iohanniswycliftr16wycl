lt is a pity that Wyelis could not avoid looking for an explanation
where there was none to be given. But the excesses of his adversaries
urged him onward, and he found a reply to them in his system. What
we see, is braid, he asserted. That is a fact, so far as the remaining of
the sensible reality is meant. But he went on to assert that the whole
nature of bread remained, transubstantiated (as he understands it) by
the fact that it becomes the figure of Christ's Body, Now, as I observed
in the Introduction to De Aposlczsicz, every figure is a reality, according
to Wyclif. It has its own truth‚ its own real, though at the same time
ideal, existence. Thus the bread is not purely what it was before con-
secration. Permeated by the reality of Christ’s figurative presence, it
becomes and is the body of our Lord. This explains all: this does
away with every mystery, and with the odious doctrine of annihilation,
which the ‘Sign-Doctors’ were driven to admit. Here, however, we see
that Wyclif goes beyond the mere doctrine of 'l‘ransubstantiatiom Believing,
as he did, in the objective reality of Universals, he no doubt believed
in'jthe Real Presence; but, driven (perhaps sorely against his will) to explain
how this presence was real, he made a dogma of the Church subservierit
to the understanding of, and the belief in, his own philosophical system.

3. Now, if the world had been made up of theologians and philo-
sophers, it is quite possible that our author's opinion would not have
been condemned. When his judges found out that he granted the
existence of Christ in the Host as a real Universa13 when they learned
that, speaking of ‘natural bread’, he meant the same as those who
talked osan ‘accidens sine subjecto’‚ they might have shrugged their
shoulders at his philosophical system, but would perhaps have left his
orthodoxy unquestioned. Unfortunately for Wyclif, the world does not
contain only philosophers and theologians. His doctrine was spread far
and wide amongst the common people, and probably few, even of his
‘poor priests’, understood it well. The vulgar thought they knew perfectly
well what ‘natural bread³ signified; and also that it was the figure of
Christ, the Bread of Life; but, when they heard that Christ was really
present, because every figure was a universal, and every universal had
real existence, they stopped short there. They were no more able to
understand him than the average man of our days is able to understand
what is meant by a fourth dimension of space, or the curvature osa

straight line.
