VIII INTRODUCTION.

The margins :irc wide, with a few words in smaller letters written upon
them here and there. Only one column to each page.

De simonia extends from f, 83 to f. 128, with blank spaces wher-
ever the copyist could not make out a word. The chapters have no
subdivisions. The Argumeuluuz is placed at the beginning; the verses
‘Explicit . . . prelatis’‚ form the conclusion. The ‘Conclusio' (ff. 127¹ — 128)
does not belong to De symonia.

3. Cod. Vindob. 4504 (c). Described by me for Mri Harris: See
De Benedicta lncarncztz‘one, Introduction, p. XII. I subjoin a fuller de-
scription of what especially concerns De simonia. This tractate extends
from f. 1 to f. 36. No title. A few corrections, both on the margin and
in the text. The remark that De (Γοιιιροείίίοηε Hominis is uou examinatus
can by no means be taken as a proof that the other MSS. are examinati.
De Simonia is also uot properly corrected. Gaps have been lest unfilled
in the places of illegible words, and many absurd blunders have been
allowed to remain. Writing of the first decade of the XV¹¹¹ century. Spaces
are left for initial letters to be filled in, The Argumentum is at the
beginning of the-book. No subdivisious of chapters. Instead of the lines:
“Explicit—prelatos”, there is “Explicit tractatus de Symonia³³.

4. Cod. Vindob. 4515 (cl). Shortly described in the Dialogus, Intro-
duction, p. XXIII; very sully in Buddensieg's Polemical IVorks os IVyclis
pp. XLVI—XLVIII.

De simonia (ff. 27-67¹). No title. Several hands, all belonging to
the first decades of the XV1¹¹ century. Many glaring blunders in the MS.
as first copied, are corrected by numerous marginal or supralinear notes;
here and there the original mistake has been erased, and the correct
text supplied. This of course considerably alters its value3 a point
to which we shall subsequently allude. There are a few catchwordS.
The chapters have no subdivisions‚ but are indicated by red initials.
The Argumentum stands first, and the lines ΕἙΧρΠοίΒ), ἃς, are

w anting.

5. Cod. Vindob. 3927 (e).
Described by Buddensieg, Pol. Works of W. I. Vol. XLIII.

De Sinzonza (ff. 53—74‘) has, besides the pagination that obtains

all through the work, a special pagination of its-own. Each of the two
pages which face each other in the open book bear the same number,
and the four columns making up the two pages are lettered a, h, c and cl
