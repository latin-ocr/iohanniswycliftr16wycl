way, to note down what Ihave long believed to be t1·ne; viz„ that
Wyclif, 101 501116 reason or other, never made a deep study 01 1116 works
01 St. Thomas. He very seldom alludes to him, at least by name, either
in his theological or in his philosophical treatises; when he does, it is
always (as 011 the present occasion) with much respect, but with no
evidence that he was well acquainted with the doctrine and the argu-
ments 0111131 famous Doctor. To any one who knows the unique position
held by St. Thomas amongst the Doctors 01 1116 Church, both in the
Middle Agnes, and even down to the present day, this will seem more
than strange; 11 15 unaccountable. Ι (10 1101 566 how it was possible 101
such a man either to know little 01 St. Thomas, or knowing much, to
refrain 110111 quoting him when in agreement, or from refuting his ar-
guments when in opposition to his own.

Simony, according to the ‘Angelic Doet01-³‚ is the deliberate will
to 5611 or buy anything spiritual or connected with spiritual things. It
is called a heresy‚ because the act implies that such purchase or sale
is allowed. It is forbidden, 101 1116 reason that none may 5611 what they
do not really possess as their own: and God's grace is the property
01 God; men are only its channels. Priests have not even the right (of
their own will) to exchange benefic-es with one another. As the Pope is
merely the distributor 01 Divine grace, not its owner, it follows that lte
can incur simony. In view 01 what comes in the following chapters, I
transcribe the whole 01 11115 important passage, which Ι 63111101 conceive
that Wyclif would have 1611 1111111101611, 11 116 had known it. “Papa potest
incurrere vitium simoniae, sicut et quilibet alius homo: peccatum enim
tanto in aliqua persona est gravius, quanto majorem obtinet locum.
Quamvis enim res Ecclesiae sint ejus, ut principalis dispensatoris, non
tamen sunt ejuS, ut domini et possessoris. Et ideo, si reciperet pro aliqua
re spirituali pecuniam de redditibus ecclesiae alicujus, non careret vitio
simoniae.¹ Et similiter etiam posset simoniam committere recipiendo peccu-
niam ab aliquo laico, non (16 bonis Ερ6165136)3 (2³2³0, (111. C. art. Ι.

sort) for the administration‘ of the Sacraments, i. 6. 101 the spiritual
grace which they confer; but only 101 1116 bodily sustentation of the
ministers of grace, and as a remuneration for their trouble. Rather than
give money for the grace conferred by Baptism, for instance, a man

ought to die without baptism, trusting to God's grace, and desiring· κ)
