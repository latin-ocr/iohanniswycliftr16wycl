money; ingress into an Order by purchase is therefore illegal, and
corrodies :ire still worse. The money paid is not a purely temporal
thing, If superfluous, it is taken from the poor; if not, it diminishes, by
so much as is paid‚ the number ‹›f monks who might live in the mo-
nastery. Is a religious house suffers from want, let it suffer. The system
of corrodies might soon bring it to such a state that it could no longer
pay them. And the bargain, such as it is, is founded upon sin, and
consequently null and void: the patron of the abbey is bound to annul
it, so that the buyer has no security whatever. Wyclif then points out
that simony is incurred on entering an Order with ambitious views‚ or
for the advantage of a comfortable and quiet life, or anything⁴ better
than could be expected in a secular state (pp. 84—88).

Simony is osten committed by monks in their daily life, by ob-
taining sunds as perpetual alms from temporal lords‚ and also by appro-
priating the incomes of parishes to their own use, promoting members
of their own orders as parish priests. It is robbery of the secular
clergy. The perfection of the religious state is thus sold for money. It
is a shameless lie to pretend that the Pope and the clergy are in want
— calculation of their revenue would give each member a thousand
marks on an average¹ — or to say that such appropriations are for
the good of the Chumh, because the Pope permits them. They pay
money to the King and others to obtain such appropriations; and thus
we find a body which has the right of perpetually naming one os its
own members to a spiritual charge. 'l'hose who allow this, acquiesce in
the future nomination of anybody, no matter whom. Christ indeed
tolerated Iscariot; but that is no reason why we should consent to the
promotion' of possible bad priests. By this system, a considerable sum
os money is annually given to the Bishop and Chapter: which is rank
simony. And where there is no appropriation, the Abbots having re-
ceived the patronage of churches from the temporal lords, have filled
them with their creatures‚ who in gratitude have granted pensions

to the Abbey (pp. 88—93).

¹ I suspect there is a slight mistake in the text here. The mark was worth
13 s. 4 d. which would be not far from ἓ 700 in our tIme. The average clergy-
man would then have been a millionnairc: if we consider the purchasing power os
the mark in those days:
