apostasy‚ blasphemy, and simony are merely different aspects ‹›f every
mortal sin. Every mortal sin is a backsliding from God; every mortal
sin is a blasphemous wish that evil may be good; every mortal sin is
an inordinate exchange of spiritual grace for some temporal good or
other; as, ι’. g. pleasure. But this, he admits, is simony only in the
widest possible sense. It is more strictly so called, when external good,
and justice between man and man, are in question; cheating is therefore
more properly simony than other sins, But it is committed in the strictest
sense of all by the clergy, when they possess more than is necessary
for their maintenance: for this is a weakening of the influence and spi-
ritual power of the Church‚ and all the good that would otherwise be
done is thus bartered for earthly commodities. And as no Catholic can
deny that voluntary poverty‚ one of the three counsels of perfection‚
would be a great gain to the clergy from a spiritual point of view, the
wilful throwing away of this great gain is strictly and logically called
simony by Wyclif. It is of course a mortal sin3 and as such, renders
the sinner liable to all the anathemas of the Fathers of the Church. But
here again we must remember that Wyclif, speaking of simony, is speak-
ing of something which, even in its strictest sense, goes far beyond
(though it includesythe regular theological definition. We may here
notice by the way how much the idea ‹›f voluntary-poverty amongst the
clergy had progressed from the days of St. Dominic and St. Francis. In
the first half of the X111¹¹¹ century, St. Thomas is obliged to defend the
right of the Friars to live in absolute poverty (S. Th. 2³¹ 2³⁰, qu.
CLXXXVII, art. 4. Utrum religiosis liceat de eleemosynis vivere, and
art. 5. Utrum liceat eis mendicare); in the latter part of the X1V¹¹¹‚
Wyclif asserts this to be the duty of the whole clergy. Surely 3 great
change had come over Christendom during that period.

We may therefore say in general —- setting aside all that by which
our author includes in the sin of simony many actions and states of
life which other theologians declare at most to fall off from Christ's
counsels, not His pre'cepts — that we find a good deal both in the
foregoing and in the following chapters which is in remarkable agree-
ment with the rules of the Church.

Chapter III. The question whether the Pope can commit simony
is answered by a strong affirmative, which Wyclif proves by several

Decretals. Simony is committed by the Pope through love of pomp and
