It is pretended that the payment of firstfruits is a free gift, but this 15
3 111616 pretence; there is a tacit, though not an explicit compact. Let
the presentee 1611156 10 pay, and he will soon see if it is considered
as a free gift. As to the payment being made after, not before pro-
motion‚ that makes no difference. (See above, p. XXIV3 St. Thomas 6011-
siders the difference to be great.) Gehazi made no compact with Naaman
before he was cured 01 1115 leprosy3 ¹vet his act was simoniacal all the
same, and leprosy fell upon him; so has spiritual leprosy fallen upon
the Popes; for leprosy means 511110111- 111 115 mystic sense. Leprosy deforms
the body, stinks in the nostrils, is most infectious‚ and causes the leper
to be separated from other men: all these characteristics are fulfilled in
simony (pp. 54—62).

Simony 35 10 patronage has long been rampant in England. It is
defended under the pretext of the Pope’s authority3 which amounts 10
setting it up against that 01 Christ. Paul withstood Peter3 and we have
the right to withstand the Pope in this. No man can put him above
Gospel Law. In so far as he follows it, he should indeed be obeyed;
but no farther. Any permission given by him to transgress it, is a dead
letter, and is no more 3 permission than 3 dead man is a man. In such
cases, the Pope himself should make satisfaction‚ being, in the wrong;
and all Christendom‚ being obliged to follow him in this, ought, whether
he does or not, to reprobate and resist such practices. Failing to do
so, it is punished, together with the Pope. How glorious it would be
101 1116 Church, if 0111· Pope Urban VI would return 10 1116 ancient state,
as it was in the days of Urban I! It is a grievous heresy to affirm that
whatever the Pope allows is allowed3 for Peter, whom Paul resisted
to his 1366, 11361 110 power to allow the commission even of one venial
sin: no more has any Pope in our times. His dispensations are valid
only in 50 131 35 God grants them with him; and the heresy which
affirms the contrary brings many others 31161 11. -— Here comes the
second and the longer of the two digressions relative to the Eucharist
(pp. 62--70>.

Chapter VI. A Bishop may incur simony, if he takes office rather
101 1116 dignity and profit which will accrue to him, than with a view
to benefit both his own soul and the Church. Also during his episco-
