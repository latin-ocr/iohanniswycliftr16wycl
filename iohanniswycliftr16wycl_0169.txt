P. 84. l. 21. A cormdy, according to an
interesting and valuable communication by Mr.
Matthew‚ “was a life annuity, granted by 3 con-
vent a ainst 311 immediate pa ment. Thus,
about 1 27. Lord William of Liliebourn made
over to the Convent of VVinchester a conside-

and certain payment in kind (hay, oats, ἅς.)
worth about 40 shillings. ln 1334, there is a
note in the Convent accounts of the last pay-

In 1330, one Richard Becke pays Ξ 50, 111

one pot of conventual beer daily.

These corrodies may have had 1110111150

wished to give his property to t 0 convent,
but could not leave himself without support.
In later times, it became 3 regular (but not
always thrifty) way of raising ready money.
When the monasteries were suppressed, one
of the enquiries that the commissioners had to
make was what corrodies each had to pay.⁷’
