If we can say, ‘This is Christ's ley’, we mean what we (10 1101 perceive,
31111 what 11·6 know 1311131111 alone, hut we know that 0116 15 as truly
present as the other. Therein lies the mystery. ’11311511115131111311011, 115
defined by the Council 0[Ί“1·6111, does not (unless Ι greatly niistake)
pretend either to solve or to explain it. It 15 a mere 3556111011 that in
the Host there 15 nothing present but Christ's real Body, and real phe-
nomena which are not Christ⁷s Body. It does not assert that anything
of 1116 1316311 15 311111111131611; 31111 11115 15 1611- important. St. Thomas ex-
pressly says the contrary; 116 says that the hread becomes (transit in)

nal and sensible change, which 111616 15 not, And yet 111616 15 an ‘other-
ness’, as modern philosophers would say. This ‘otherness’, which super-
venes without in the least affecting any of the properties of the thing
that was, is the Real Ρ16561166; 31111 what takes place is called, sor want
of a better term, 'I‘ransubstantiation Such is the doctrine of the Church
of Rome, which leaves the mystery just as it was before, It condemns
those who say that Christ is present, not really, but in figure, because
that would be against Scripture. It condemns (or at least, Ι think,
disapproves) those who assume that the bread is annihilated, and that
God 6163165 3 fantastic appearance, a permanent hallucination; for this
would attack the evidence of our 5611565. Ι1 condemns those who say that
the bread‚ remaining mere bread, becomes Christ's Body (consubstan-
tiation), for this would be tantamount to saying that a 111311, remaining
3 pauper, becomes a millionnaire. In short, it condemns all those who
either assail the sensible reality causing our percepts, and the non-sen-
sible 1631111ν of what saith affirms 10 be present. And Ι 1111511 especially
to call attention to the fact that the Council of Trent, in its declaration
on the subject, nowhere decides that the accidents remain without a
subject; it merely 3556115 11131 311 1116 appearances 31111 properties —
which coi'ncide with what I have called sensible reality -- remain un-
changed: and yet, in 3 66113111 mysterious sense, it is no longer bread,

since it has become the Body of our Lorcl.
