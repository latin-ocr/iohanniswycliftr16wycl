A Bishop's corporal labour is worth no more than that of a layman,
unless we consider it in connexion with his standing as a Bishop. If this
is a real pax-ment, the Bishop has the right to exact more, according as
his position is higher and the demand — the necessity of the ssock —

given to him, at a ceremony which he performs gratuitously on his
own part. But all this —- 35 Ι1111066111 writes in the Decretals, forbidding
