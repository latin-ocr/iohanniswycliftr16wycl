ΧΠ INTRODUCTION.

necting link between them and Ιι. The readings of a b c d e fg very
often agree in contradicting Ιι. and i, and there can be no doubt that
these seven MSS. were copied from the very same source. There are
many proofs of this; but it will suffice here to select one of the most
striking, on p. 81, l. 24, 25. The words from fructum to ministerio
are absent from a b c e f g, and have been supplied by another hand
in cl. This agreement is certainly not accidental, and can be accounted
for only by the supposition of a common source. This original (Z), there-
fore, stands in the same sisterly relation to i as Y to the source of Ιι.

But a h c d e fg* do not all proceed from Z in the same way.
Ι think that only h, cl (before correction) and swere copied directly
from Z; and even for these, the hypothesis ofintermediate copies might
be allowed, on account of a nearer relationship between h and f,
and a closer agreement ‹›f cl with Ιι and i, At all events the resemblance
between c and e on the one hand, and a (before correction) and g on
the other, is strikingly close, and extends even to the spelling. This fol-
lows from the variants in the foot-notes, and would appear with still
greater evidence, were it not for the difficulties mentioned at the ‹›utset.
These prevented, not only a caresul selection ‹›f the variants of c and e
(partly, too, off), but also a proper correction of the proof-sheets.
The relationship of cz with g may also be demonstrated by a proos extrinsic
to the text: the index of catchwords, which (as Ι have carefully ascer-
tained) belongs to these MSS. alone. A close examination has shown me the
impossibility os α and c being copied from g and (ς’ or rice versa. We can
only srame a third hypothesis, via, that cz and g are copies ‹›f another MS.
(A) and that c and e proceed again from another (B) So that Α and B,
which have not come down to us, stand in the same relation to Z as lv,

d, and s. The transmission of the nine MSS. may, therefore, be set

forth in the following diagram:
